# nodebb-plugin-subcategories-checker
Show subcatgories on top

By default, a NodeBB forum only shows posts belonging to a specific category. If you install the `nodebb-plugin-merge-subtopics` plugin,
topics from the subcategories are shown as well.

This plugin works with the aforementioned plugin, and allows you to add checkboxes next to the sub-categories names. User may check and
uncheck the boxes, and the window automatically show/hide topics belonging to those subcategories.

Post from the current category are always visible.

This plugin may break if your theme is not compatible, and as not been tested too much outside its regular setup.
